Malaria is a deleterious blood disease that can engender death in humans and is caused by
different parasites, namely Plasmodium falciparum, P. ovale, P. malariae, P. knowlesi, and
P. vivax (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). According to the World Health
Organization (WHO), 627,000 humans died from malaria, and 241 million instances of the
malady were reported in 2020 (WHO, 2021). The life-threatening damages from the disease
can be averted by timely detection and treatment. Although manual examinations of blood
samples under thick/thin-film microscope to diagnose malaria and the causative parasite are
the most established and frequently used method to detect the disease (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2022), the process can be demanding, and the result can be impacted
by human error.
